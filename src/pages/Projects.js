The user persona here is an example of a user who really wants to read books and is lazy or cannot travel to a bookstore or library to borrow and buy books, or maybe a user who wants to read books, but the books he wants to read are too expensive, users who want to collect books but the books do not want to be damaged because they are placed for too long or displayed for too long.",
